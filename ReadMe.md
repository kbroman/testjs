### testjs: R package to test use of htmlwidgets package

[Karl W Broman](http://kbroman.org)

[htmlwidgets](http://htmlwidgets.org) is an R package to facilitate
the use of javascript-based data visualization from R.

The current package is a simple package for me to play with as I learn
to use htmlwidgets.
